Program Execution Trace Specification
===================================

Trace Format Definition:
-----------------------
Each trace entry must conform to the following specification:
- Syntax: `L{line_number},{variable_name}:{value}`
- Line numbers must be prefixed with 'L'
- Variable updates must be separated by commas
- Values must be separated from variables by colons

Trace Rules:
-----------
1. Variable Assignment Traces:
   - Required for all variable modifications
   - Must include line number, variable name, and new value
   - Example: `L2,x:5`

2. Control Flow Traces:
   - Required for if, while, for statements
   - Format: `L{line_number},`
   - Example: `L3,`

3. Loop Execution Requirements:
   - While loops must be fully expanded
   - Each iteration must be explicitly traced
   - Condition evaluation must be recorded
   - All variable modifications must be recorded
   - No iteration may be omitted

Program to Trace:
```
{input_program}
```

Input Values:
```
function({function_args})
```

Trace Output (beginning with ```L2,):
