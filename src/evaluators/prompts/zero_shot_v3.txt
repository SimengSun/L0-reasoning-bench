Your task is to trace the execution of a Python program step by step. Think of yourself as a debugger that needs to record every state change in the program.

Here's how to create the trace:

1. For each line of code that executes:
   - If the line changes a variable's value, record: `L{line_number},{variable_name}:{new_value}`
   - If the line is a control statement (if/while/for), just record: `L{line_number},`

2. For while loops:
   - Record the condition check every time it's evaluated
   - Record all variable updates inside the loop body
   - Do not skip any iterations - show each step of the loop execution

Example trace:
1) when there is value update: `L3,x:10`
2) when no variable is updated: `L10,`

Program to trace:
```
{input_program}
```

Input values:
```
function({function_args})
```

Begin your trace with ```L2, and show each step of execution:

Output:
